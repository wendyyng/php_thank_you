    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p class="text-center">
        The #ThankYouFrontLineWorkers campaign is a way for us to express our
        gratitude for all that our COVID-19 frontline workers have done for us.
        We afford businesses, organisations, families, and individuals the opportunity to express their gratitude to COVID-19 essential workers including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Healthcare and support staff</li>
        <li>First Responders</li>
        <li>Retail and supply chain</li>
        <li>Educators and paraprofessionals</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-center">
        Our COVID-19 frontline heroes are still suffering from emotional trauma and physical fatigue.
        We are expressing our gratitude for all that our heroes have sacrificed for us.
        Join us in sending them meaningful messages of support.
