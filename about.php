    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Healthcare and support staff</li>
        <li>First Responders</li>
        <li>Retail and supply chain</li>
        <li>Educators and paraprofessionals</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-center">
        Our COVID-19 frontline heroes are still suffering from emotional trauma and physical fatigue.
        We are expressing our gratitude for all that our heroes have sacrificed for us.
